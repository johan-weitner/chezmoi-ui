      "summary": "This HTML code creates a simple frontend webpage with a paragraph and a button. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate a basic frontend setup and event handling using JavaScript. \n\nThe `<html>` tag defines the document as an HTML document with the specified language. The `<head>` section contains metadata like character set, viewport settings, and the page title. The `<body>` section contains the visible content of the webpage.\n\nThe JavaScript function `onButtonClick()` is defined within a `<script>` tag in the `<head>` section. This function displays an alert message when the button is clicked.\n\nThe `<button>` element in the `<body>` section has an `onclick` attribute that calls the `onButtonClick()` function when the button is clicked. This demonstrates event handling in JavaScript.\n\nIn the larger project, this code snippet could serve as a starting point for building more complex frontend interfaces. Developers can expand upon this code by adding more elements, styling, and functionality to create a fully-featured user interface. \n\nExample:\n```html\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\">\n    <title>My Simple Frontend</title>\n    <script>\n        function onButtonClick() {\n            alert(\"Button clicked!\");\n        }\n    </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <p>Welcome to my simple frontend!</p>\n    <button onclick=\"onButtonClick()\">Click me!</button>\n</body>\n</html>\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `onButtonClick` function in the script tag?\n   \n   - The `onButtonClick` function is triggered when the button is clicked and displays an alert message. \n\n2. Why is the `meta` tag with `http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\"` included in the `head` section?\n   \n   - The `meta` tag with `http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\"` is used to specify the version of Internet Explorer to use for rendering the webpage.\n\n3. Why is the `viewport` meta tag set to `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0`?\n   \n   - The `viewport` meta tag is used to control the layout on different devices by setting the width to the device's width and initial scale to 1.0."
