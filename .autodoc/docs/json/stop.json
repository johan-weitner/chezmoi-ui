  "summary": "This bash script is responsible for stopping processes by reading their respective PID files located in `/tmp`. It first checks if the PID file for the client process exists. If it does, it reads the PID, stops the process using `kill`, removes the PID file, and displays a message confirming the process has been stopped. If the PID file does not exist, it outputs a message indicating that the PID file was not found.\n\nSimilarly, the script then checks for the existence of the PID file for the server process. If found, it follows the same process of stopping the server process, removing the PID file, and displaying a confirmation message. If the PID file is not found, it outputs a message indicating that the PID file was not found.\n\nThis script can be used in a larger project to manage the starting and stopping of processes related to a web server and backend server. It provides a convenient way to stop these processes by simply running the script, which can be integrated into deployment or maintenance scripts for the project. \n\nExample usage:\n```bash\n./stop_processes.sh\n```\n\nThis script would then stop the client and server processes if they are running, providing feedback on the actions taken.",
  "questions": "1. Why are the PID files stored in `/tmp` directory?\n   \n   The PID files are stored in the `/tmp` directory to keep track of the process IDs of the web server and backend processes.\n\n2. What happens if the process cannot be stopped using `kill` command?\n\n   If the process cannot be stopped using the `kill` command, an error message will not be displayed, and the PID file will remain in the `/tmp` directory.\n\n3. Is there any error handling in place for cases where the PID file exists but the process is not running?\n\n   No, there is no specific error handling in place for cases where the PID file exists but the process is not running. The script simply checks for the existence of the PID file and attempts to stop the process."
