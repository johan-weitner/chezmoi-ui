The provided code is a bash script that automates the process of starting the backend server and web server for the chezmoi-ui project. 

1. The script first clears the terminal for a clean display.
2. It then changes the directory to the 'server' folder and starts the Node.js server by running the 'index.js' file in the background using the '&' symbol.
3. The process ID (PID) of the server is captured and stored in a file named 'srvprocess.pid' in the '/tmp' directory.
4. Next, the script changes the directory to the 'client' folder and starts the development server for the UI using 'pnpm run dev' in the background.
5. The PID of the client process is captured and stored in a file named 'clientprocess.pid' in the '/tmp' directory.
6. Finally, the script moves back to the parent directory.

This script streamlines the process of starting both the backend and web servers for the chezmoi-ui project, making it easier for developers to quickly spin up the necessary servers for local development. By automating these steps, developers can focus on working on the project rather than manually starting the servers each time. 

Example usage:
```bash
chmod +x start-servers.sh
./start-servers.sh
```
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of saving the process IDs to `/tmp/srvprocess.pid` and `/tmp/clientprocess.pid`?**
   
   - The process IDs are being saved to these files in order to easily manage and monitor the running server and client processes.

2. **Why are the server and client processes being run in the background using `&`?**
   
   - Running the processes in the background allows the script to continue executing without waiting for the processes to finish, enabling parallel execution.

3. **What is the significance of the commented out lines that mention the PIDs of the server and client processes?**
   
   - These lines were likely used for debugging or logging purposes, providing information about the PIDs of the running processes, but have been commented out in the current version of the code.
