This code sets up an Express server that serves as an API for managing software data. It reads software data from a file, allows clients to retrieve the software list, save new software data, and retrieve the raw list in YAML format.

The server listens on a specified port (default 3000) and has endpoints for retrieving software data, saving new software data, and retrieving the raw list in YAML format. The software data is read from a file specified in `targetFilePath`.

The `attachHeaders` function adds CORS headers to the response to allow cross-origin requests. The server also sets up middleware for parsing JSON requests and limiting request size.

The `/software` endpoint returns the list of software. The `/rawlist` endpoint returns the raw software list in YAML format. The `/save` endpoint allows clients to save new software data to the file.

Overall, this code provides a simple API for managing software data, allowing clients to retrieve, save, and view software information. It can be used in a larger project to handle software management and configuration tasks. 

Example usage:
- GET request to `/software` endpoint returns the list of software.
- POST request to `/save` endpoint with JSON data saves new software data.
- GET request to `/rawlist` endpoint returns the raw software list in YAML format.
## Questions: 
 1. Why is the `boot()` function being called and what does it do?
   
   The `boot()` function is being called to initialize `softwareArray` and `software` variables. It likely sets up initial data or configurations needed for the application to run.

2. What is the purpose of the `/rawlist` endpoint and why is YAML used?
   
   The `/rawlist` endpoint serves raw data from a file specified by `targetFilePath` in YAML format. YAML is used for human-readable structured data representation.

3. How is error handling implemented in the `/save` endpoint?
   
   Error handling in the `/save` endpoint checks if the request body is empty and returns an error response if it is. It also catches any errors that occur during saving the data to the file and returns an error response with the specific error message.
