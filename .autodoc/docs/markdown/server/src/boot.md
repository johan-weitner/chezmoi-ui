The code in this file serves as the initialization process for the backend server in the chezmoi-ui project. 

1. The `boot` function is the main entry point, where it:
   - Prints the application logo.
   - Checks for required environment variables (SOURCE_FILE and TARGET_FILE).
   - Checks if the necessary files exist.
   - Sets up the file data by either opening an existing work-in-progress file or reading the source file.

2. The `_checkEnvVars` function ensures that the required environment variables are set, and exits the process if they are missing.

3. The `_checkFileExistence` function checks if the specified source and work files exist, and exits the process if they are missing.

4. The `_setupFileData` function initializes the software data by either opening an existing work-in-progress file or reading the source file to seed a starting point.

The code also exports a set of styles for logging and formatting output in the application, including styles for success, warning, error messages, bold text, italic text, and symbols like checkmarks and warning signs.

Overall, this code sets up the necessary environment, checks for file existence, and initializes the software data for the backend server in the chezmoi-ui project. Developers can use this code to ensure the server is properly configured and ready to handle software data. 

Example usage:
```javascript
import { boot } from 'chezmoi-ui';

const server = boot();
// This will initialize the backend server and return the software array and object.
```
## Questions: 
 1. What are the styles available for logging and formatting output in the application?
   
   - The styles available for logging and formatting output in the application include `success`, `warn`, `error`, `bold`, `italic`, `check`, `cross`, and `wsign`.

2. What steps are taken during the initialization of the backend server in the `boot` function?
   
   - During the initialization of the backend server in the `boot` function, the application logo is printed, required environment variables are checked, file existence is verified, setup info is printed, and file data is set up.

3. How is the file data set up in the `_setupFileData` function?
   
   - In the `_setupFileData` function, if the work file exists, it is opened and read to retrieve the software data. If the work file does not exist, the source file is read to seed a starting point for the software data.
