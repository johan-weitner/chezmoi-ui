## Code Explanation

The `getStringArray` function takes an array as input and returns a new array containing only the `name` property of each object in the input array. This is achieved by using the `reduce` method to iterate over the input array, extracting the `name` property of each object, and adding it to the accumulator array.

```javascript
const inputArray = [{ name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' }];
const result = getStringArray(inputArray);
// result will be ['Alice', 'Bob']
```

The `nullCheck` function is a simple utility function that checks if the input array is null or undefined. If the input array is null or undefined, it returns an empty array. This can be useful to prevent errors when working with arrays that may be null or undefined.

```javascript
const inputArray = null;
const result = nullCheck(inputArray);
// result will be []
```

These functions can be used in the larger project to manipulate arrays and handle null values in a consistent and reliable manner. `getStringArray` can be used to extract specific properties from objects in an array, while `nullCheck` can be used to ensure that arrays are always properly initialized before performing operations on them.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `getStringArray` function?**
   - The `getStringArray` function takes an array of objects and returns an array of strings containing the `name` property of each object.

2. **Why is the `nullCheck` function needed?**
   - The `nullCheck` function checks if the input array is null or undefined, and if so, returns an empty array. This helps prevent errors when working with potentially null arrays.

3. **Are there any potential performance implications of using `reduce` in the `getStringArray` function?**
   - Using `reduce` to build the new array in `getStringArray` may have performance implications for large arrays due to the creation of a new array on each iteration. Developers might consider the performance impact when working with large datasets.
