The `DetailView` component renders a detailed view of a selected application, displaying its name, short description, full description, and links to its homepage, documentation, and GitHub repository. It also includes buttons to edit or delete the selected application.

The component receives props such as the selected application object, functions to delete or edit the application, the current theme object, and functions to navigate to the previous or next application.

Within the component, it checks if the selected application has an installer specified and generates tags based on the application's properties. It then displays the application details, including links, descriptions, indicators for homepage, documentation, and GitHub presence, and tags if available. Additionally, it shows a warning if no installer is specified.

The component provides buttons to edit or delete the application, triggering the corresponding functions passed as props.

This component is a crucial part of the UI in the project, allowing users to view and interact with detailed information about selected applications. It enhances the user experience by providing a comprehensive overview and easy access to essential actions like editing and deleting applications.

Example usage:
```jsx
<DetailView
  selectedApp={selectedApp}
  deleteItem={handleDelete}
  editItem={handleEdit}
  theme={currentTheme}
  gotoPrev={navigateToPrev}
  gotoNext={navigateToNext}
/>
```
