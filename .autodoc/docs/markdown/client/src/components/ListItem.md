The `ListItem` component in the `MainView.module.css` file renders a list item that displays software information and provides actions to select, edit, and delete the item. 

The component takes in props such as `software` (object containing software information), `selectApp` (function to handle selecting the app), `editItem` (function to handle editing the item), `deleteItem` (function to handle deleting the item), and `item` (identifier of the item).

When rendered, the component displays a button with the software name. It also includes icons for editing and deleting the item. Clicking on the edit icon triggers the `editItem` function with the item identifier, while clicking on the delete icon triggers the `deleteItem` function with the item identifier.

This component can be used in a larger project where a list of software items needs to be displayed with options to select, edit, and delete each item. By passing the necessary props to the `ListItem` component, developers can easily render a customizable list of software items with interactive functionalities.

Example usage:
```jsx
<ListItem
  software={softwareData}
  selectApp={handleSelectApp}
  editItem={handleEditItem}
  deleteItem={handleDeleteItem}
  item="item1"
/>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `rem` function imported from "@mantine/core"?
   
   - The `rem` function is likely used to convert pixel values to rem units for consistent sizing across different screen sizes.

2. Why are the edit and remove icons positioned absolutely within the list item component?
   
   - The icons are positioned absolutely to ensure they are consistently placed in the same location relative to the list item, regardless of its content or size.

3. How is the software information accessed and displayed within the list item component?
   
   - The software information is accessed using the `item` identifier and displayed using the `_name` property of the `software` object.
