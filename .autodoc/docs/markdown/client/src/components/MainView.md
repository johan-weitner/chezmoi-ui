The `MainView` component is a crucial part of the application responsible for rendering the main header, list view, and detail view. It manages the state and logic for selecting an app, opening/closing the app form popover, and handling keyboard shortcuts.

The component receives props containing software data, functions for deleting, saving, starting over, updating, and adding new apps. It uses Mantine theme and maintains state for the selected app and popover visibility.

Keyboard shortcuts are defined using the `useHotkeys` hook, allowing users to perform actions like closing the popover, navigating between items, saving, editing, and creating new records efficiently.

The component renders the main header, list view, and detail view within a `Container` component. It dynamically displays the selected app's details and allows users to interact with the app data through various actions like editing, deleting, and navigating between items.

Overall, `MainView` enhances the user experience by providing a centralized view for managing app data and interactions. It encapsulates key functionalities and UI elements essential for the application's workflow, making it a core component in the larger project.

Example usage:
```jsx
import MainView from "./MainView";

const App = () => {
  // Define functions for managing app data
  const software = {...};
  const deleteApp = () => {...};
  const save = () => {...};
  const startOver = () => {...};
  const updateItem = () => {...};
  const addNewApp = () => {...};

  return (
    <MainView
      software={software}
      deleteApp={deleteApp}
      save={save}
      startOver={startOver}
      updateItem={updateItem}
      addNewApp={addNewApp}
    />
  );
};
```

In summary, `MainView` plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the main functionalities and views of the application, ensuring a seamless user experience and efficient app management.
