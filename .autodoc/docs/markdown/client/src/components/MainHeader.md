The `MainHeader` component in the `chezmoi-ui` project renders the main header of the application. It consists of buttons for saving the current state and downloading YAML data. The component takes in two functions as props: `save` and `startOver`, which are called when the corresponding buttons are clicked.

The `MainHeader` component creates an array of objects called `links`, each containing an icon, label, and action. The icons are imported from a constant file, and the actions are either the `save` function or a function that opens a new window to download YAML data.

The component then maps over the `links` array to create a set of `Button` components, each with the specified icon, label, and onClick action.

Finally, the `MainHeader` component returns a header element containing a `Container` with a set of buttons rendered inside a `Group` component. The buttons are aligned to the right and styled with a transparent variant.

This component is crucial for providing users with essential actions like saving data and downloading YAML files. It enhances the user experience by offering easy access to these functionalities from the main header of the application.

Example usage:
```jsx
<MainHeader save={handleSave} startOver={handleStartOver} />
```
