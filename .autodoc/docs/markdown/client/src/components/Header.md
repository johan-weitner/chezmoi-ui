The `Header` component in the `chezmoi-ui` project renders the header for the application. It consists of the application logo and title, both contained within a centered container. 

The `Header` component takes in props, although in this case, it does not use them. It uses the `Container` component from the `@mantine/core` library to create a centered container with a medium size. Inside this container, it displays the application logo using the `logo` imported from `logo.svg` and the application title "Chezmoi UI" using the `Title` component.

This component is crucial for providing a consistent and visually appealing header across the application. It helps in branding the application by displaying the logo and title prominently at the top of the page. Developers can easily customize the header by changing the logo, title, or styling of the container.

Here is an example of how the `Header` component can be used in a larger project:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Header from "./Header";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      {/* Other components and content of the application */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the `Header` component is imported and used at the top of the `App` component to display the header for the entire application. This promotes reusability and maintainability by encapsulating the header logic in a separate component.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of importing `Title` and `Container` from "@mantine/core" in this code?
   
   - The developer might wonder what specific functionality or styling these components provide to the header component.
   
2. Why is the logo imported as an image file in this code?
   
   - The developer might be curious about the significance of using an image file for the logo rather than defining it directly in the code.
   
3. How is the `Header` component being styled with the `classes.header` className?
   
   - The developer might want to know how the styles defined in the `Header.module.css` file are being applied to the `Container` component in the `Header` component.
