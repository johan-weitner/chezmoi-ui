This code defines a constant `TAGS_WHITE_LIST` which is an array of strings representing allowed tags in the application. These tags categorize different types of content that can be associated with items in the application. 

For example, in a file management application like chezmoi-ui, these tags could be used to categorize files or folders based on their platform compatibility ("mac", "win", "linux"), usage ("work", "home"), or type ("cli", "desktop", "dev"). 

By defining a whitelist of allowed tags, the application can ensure that only specific tags are used to categorize items, maintaining consistency and organization within the application. 

Developers working on the project can refer to this whitelist when implementing features related to tagging items, ensuring that only the specified tags are used. 

For example, when creating a new item in the application, developers can check if the selected tags are included in the `TAGS_WHITE_LIST` array before associating them with the item. 

Overall, this code plays a crucial role in maintaining a structured and organized system for categorizing items within the application based on predefined tags.
