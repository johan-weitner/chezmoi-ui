The `initHotKeys` function in this code snippet initializes hotkeys for a UI component in the chezmoi-ui project. It uses the `useHotkeys` hook from the `react-hotkeys-hook` library to define key combinations and corresponding actions. 

- When the "esc" key is pressed, the `setIsPopoverOpen` function is called with `false` as an argument, presumably to close a popover or modal.
- Pressing "alt + b" triggers the `gotoPrev` function, which likely navigates to the previous item or page.
- Pressing "alt + n" invokes the `gotoNext` function, which probably navigates to the next item or page.

This code snippet enhances user experience by providing keyboard shortcuts for common actions, making the UI more accessible and efficient. By encapsulating hotkey initialization in a separate function, the code promotes modularity and reusability. 

In the larger project, this code would likely be integrated into a specific component or feature that requires keyboard shortcuts for navigation or interaction. Developers can easily incorporate this functionality by calling `initHotKeys` with the necessary functions to handle key presses. 

Example usage:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isPopoverOpen, setIsPopoverOpen] = useState(false);

  const gotoPrev = () => {
    // logic to navigate to previous item
  };

  const gotoNext = () => {
    // logic to navigate to next item
  };

  initHotKeys(setIsPopoverOpen, gotoPrev, gotoNext);

  return <div>My Component</div>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```
## Questions: 
 1. **How are the hotkeys triggered in the UI?**
   - The smart developer might wonder how the hotkeys are triggered and if there are any specific conditions for them to work.

2. **What actions are performed when each hotkey is pressed?**
   - The developer might want to know what specific actions are triggered when the "esc", "alt + b", and "alt + n" hotkeys are pressed.

3. **Are there any other hotkeys or functionalities implemented in this code?**
   - The developer might be curious if there are any additional hotkeys or functionalities implemented in this code beyond the ones mentioned in the `initHotKeys` function.
