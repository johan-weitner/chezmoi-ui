The `mergeLists` function takes two arrays, `allApps` and `softwarePackages`, and merges them based on certain conditions. It filters out unwanted items from the `softwarePackages` array, then creates a new array of software names from the filtered keys. It also filters out unwanted items from the `mergedPkgs` array.

Next, it iterates over the `allApps` array, checking if each item is included in the `softwareNames` array or `softwareKeys` array. If it finds a match, it adds the item and its corresponding package from `softwarePackages` to the `mergedArray`. If no match is found, it creates a default object with placeholders for various properties.

Finally, the function returns the `mergedArray`, which contains a combination of items from both input arrays based on the specified conditions.

This function is likely used in the project to combine a list of all available applications (`allApps`) with a list of software packages (`softwarePackages`) and create a new list that includes only the relevant software packages along with some default properties for missing packages. This merged list can then be used for further processing or display within the project. 

Example usage:
```javascript
const allApps = ["App1", "App2", "App3"];
const softwarePackages = {
  "App1": { name: "Application 1" },
  "App3": { name: "Application 3" }
};

const mergedList = mergeLists(allApps, softwarePackages);
console.log(mergedList);
// Output: [{ "App1": { name: "Application 1" } }, { "App2": { _name: "App2", _bin: "App2", ... } }, { "App3": { name: "Application 3" } }]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `unwanted` array and how is it used in the `mergeLists` function?
   
   - The `unwanted` array contains specific keys that should be excluded from the merging process. It is used to filter out unwanted items from the software packages before merging.

2. What is the significance of the `hits` array in the `mergeLists` function?

   - The `hits` array is used to store the software packages that were successfully merged into the final result. It keeps track of the packages that matched with the items in `allApps`.

3. What is the `merged` object in the `mergeLists` function and how is it being used?

   - The `merged` object is referenced in the code, but it is not defined within the function. This could lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior if `merged.softwarePackages` is intended to be used for merging but is not properly initialized.
