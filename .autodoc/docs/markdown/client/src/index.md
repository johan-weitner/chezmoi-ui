This code snippet defines the global styles for the UI of the chezmoi project. It sets the font family, line height, font weight, colors, and other styling properties for various elements like root, links, buttons, body, headings, and media queries for light color scheme preference.

The `:root` selector sets the base font family, line height, font weight, and color scheme for the entire document. Links (`a`) are styled with a specific font weight, color, and hover color. The `body` element is set to flex display to center its content vertically and horizontally, with a minimum width and height.

Headings (`h1`) have a specific font size and line height. Buttons are styled with border radius, padding, font size, weight, and background color. They also have hover and focus styles for interactivity.

Additionally, there is a media query for light color scheme preference, where the colors are adjusted for better readability in a light theme.

This code ensures a consistent and visually appealing UI across the chezmoi project. Developers can easily apply these styles to different components and elements to maintain a cohesive design language. For example, they can use the defined button styles like this:

```html
<button>Click me</button>
```
## Questions: 
 1. Why are different font families specified in the `font-family` property of the `:root` selector?
   
   - The different font families are specified as fallback options in case the primary font, Inter, is not available on the user's system.

2. What is the purpose of the `font-synthesis: none;` property in the `:root` selector?

   - The `font-synthesis: none;` property disables font synthesis, which prevents the browser from artificially bolding or italicizing text that is not available in a specific font weight or style.

3. Why are different background colors specified for the `:root` selector based on the `prefers-color-scheme` media query?

   - The different background colors are specified to provide a consistent user experience based on the user's preferred color scheme (light or dark mode) set in their operating system or browser.
